The long-term research goal is to build robust models for modern AI, such as pre-trained models and large models. We create new theory, algorithms, applications, and open-sourced library to achieve our goal.
These days, we are specifically interested in **robustness in large language models (LLMs)**.

Our research consists of the following topics with selected publications: [[View by year](https://jd92.wang/publications/)]
