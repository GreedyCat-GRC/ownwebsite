I'm currently taking my master's degree at [Beijing Normal University(BNU)](http://www.bnu.edu.cn/), majoring in [Mathematics & Applied Mathematics](http://math.bnu.edu.cn/). I previously worked as a Research Assistant in [Smart Media Computing Lab](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/news/index.htm) at Beijing Normal University, in which I mainly worked on Image Denoising and Video Flare Removal.

**Research interest:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NeRF. These days, I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) robustness.
